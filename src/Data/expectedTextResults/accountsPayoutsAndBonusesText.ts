Your account is strictly for personal use. Sharing your account with others or using it for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and may result in account closure.
We may request identity verification documents at any time, including (but not limited to) a valid ID, proof of address, payment method ownership, or a selfie/video verification. If you fail to comply within 30 days or provide false documentation, we reserve the right to block your account and withhold any payments.

Due to this, any deposit has to be wagered 3 times (the player must place bets three times their deposit amount) before the withdrawal of funds connected to this deposit is available.

Bonus deposits must be wagered at least 1x before withdrawal is permitted.
We do not charge fees for deposits or withdrawals on our end, except as provided by the Terms of Service and the Accounts, payouts & bonuses policy. However, if a bank transfer is used, any third-party processing or bank fees will be deducted from the withdrawal amount.
Progressive jackpot winnings are paid as quickly as possible based on payment processor availability and jurisdictional restrictions.
In case of suspicious behavior (e.g., bonus abuse, structured deposits/withdrawals, money laundering), we reserve the right to withhold funds and report the activity to relevant authorities.The player is responsible for the payment of the applicable taxes in his/her country of residence. In case of winning, a player has the right to refuse such winnings at his/her own discretion. In this case, the results of the game session or event that led to the accrual of such winnings are considered canceled.

Any such action may result in account suspension and the forfeiture of all account funds.
The use of bonus funds purely to progress through the bonus stages is prohibited. For example, when bonus or cash funds are used purely to progress through the bonus stages (e.g. collecting 9 out of 10 coins to reach that bonus feature) and then final stages (e.g. playing to collect the final coin to reach 10 out of 10 coins to reach the bonus feature) completed with cash bets when bonus funds have been forfeited, lost or wagering met and converted to cash. All the winnings gained during that play may be considered void.
If the wagering requirements are not met by the time the bonus expires, both this bonus and the winnings derived from it will be canceled.

No-deposit offers and bonuses not specified in the General Information on Bonuses and Promotions, provided to players by the casino staff (e.g., the support department), may have different conditions that must be clarified by players before using the no-deposit bonuses. The casino staff will do their best to notify players about the conditions applied upon the player’s request. Otherwise, by accepting the no-deposit bonus and playing it, the player agreed to its terms by default.
In case of any discrepancy between the English version and the non-English version of these Bonus Terms, the English version shall always prevail.
TombRiches Casino management has the right to update bonus terms at any time.
